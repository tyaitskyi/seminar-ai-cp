This is the problem statement:

Back in time, the seven-year-old Nora used to play lots of games with her creation ROBO_Head-02, both to have fun and enhance his abilities.

One day, Nora's adoptive father, Phoenix Wyle, brought Nora n boxes of toys. Before unpacking, Nora decided to make a fun game for ROBO.

She labeled all n boxes with n distinct integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and asked ROBO to do the following action several (possibly zero) times:
Pick three distinct indices i, j, and k, such that a_i ∣ a_j and a_i ∣ a_k . In other words, a_i divides both a_j and a_k, that is a_j mod a_i = 0, a_k mod a_i = 0.
After choosing, Nora will give the k-th box to ROBO, and he will place it on top of the box pile at his side. Initially, the pile is empty.

After doing so, the box k becomes unavailable for any further actions.
Being amused after nine different tries of the game, Nora asked ROBO to  calculate the number of possible different piles having the largest amount of boxes in them. Two piles are considered different if there  exists a position where those two piles have different boxes.

Since ROBO was still in his infant stages, and Nora was still too young to concentrate for a long time, both fell asleep before finding the final answer. Can you help them?

As the number of such piles can be very large, you should print the answer modulo 10^9+7.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (3 <= n <= 60), denoting the number of boxes.

The second line contains n distinct integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 60), where a_i is the label of the i-th box.

Output

Print the number of distinct piles having the maximum number of boxes that ROBO_Head can have, modulo 10^9 + 7.

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming and the concept of divisibility. Here is a Python solution:

```python
import sys
input = sys.stdin.readline

mod = 10**9 + 7

def solve():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [0] + a
    dp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]
    dp[0][0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in range(i, n+1):
            for k in range(1, n+1):
                if a[k] % a[i] == 0 and k != i:
                    dp[j][i] += dp[j-1][k]
                    dp[j][i] %= mod
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        ans += dp[n-1][i]
        ans %= mod
    print(ans)

solve()
```

This solution works by maintaining a 2D dp array where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to form a pile of size i with the top box being j. The dp array is filled in a bottom-up manner by iterating over all possible boxes and checking if the current box can be placed on top of another box. The final answer is the sum of dp[n-1][i] for all i, which represents the number of ways to form a pile of maximum size.

Note that the modulo operation is performed at each step to prevent overflow. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^3) and the space complexity is O(n^2).


>> User:
Provide an optimal solution using these lemmas:

Lemma 1: For each vertex 𝑢∈𝑇, there exist a vertex in 𝑆 that has an outgoing edge to 𝑢.
Lemma 2: If at least one vertex in 𝑇 is on, we can turn all other vertices in 𝑇 on.
Lemma 3: When perform the above operation, it is sufficient to consider only all triples (𝑢,𝑣,𝑤) such that 𝑢∈𝑆 and 𝑣,𝑤∈𝑇.

def solve():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))

    for i in a:
        if i in T:
            S.add(i)
        else:
            T.add(i)
    S = list(S)
    T = list(T)
    n_S = len(S)
    n_T = len(T)
    dp = [[0]*(n_T+1) for _ in range(n_S+1)]
    for i in range(n_T+1):
        dp[0][i] = 1
    for i in range(1, n_S+1):
        for j in range(1, n_T+1):
            if T[j-1] % S[i-1] == 0:
                for k in range(1, n_T+1):
                    if T[k-1] % S[i-1] == 0 and k != j:
                        dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][k]
                        dp[i][j] %= mod
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n_T+1):
        ans += dp[n_S][i]
        ans %= mod
    print(ans)

solve()
```

This solution works by first dividing the numbers into two sets S and T, where S contains the numbers that can be divided by at least one other number, and T contains the numbers that cannot be divided by any other number.

Then, it initializes a 2D dp array where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to form a pile of size i with the top box being j, considering only the numbers in S and T.

Finally, it fills the dp array in a bottom-up manner by iterating over all possible numbers in S and T, and checking if the current number can be placed on top of another number. The final answer is the sum of dp[n_S][i] for all i, which represents the number of ways to form a pile of maximum size.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) and the space complexity is O(n^2).
