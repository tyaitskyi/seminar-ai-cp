>> Claude 3.5 Sonnet:
Here is a Python solution that uses a more optimal approach to solve the problem:
```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    diff = b - a
    if diff < 0:
        diff = -diff
    n = 2 * diff
    while n % diff != 0:
        n += 2 * diff
    d = c + diff
    if d % n == 0 and d > 0 and d <= n:
        print(d)
    else:
        print(-1)
```
Here's how it works:

1. We read the number of test cases `t` and iterate over each test case.
2. For each test case, we read the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. We calculate the absolute difference between `b` and `a` and store it in `diff`.
4. We calculate the smallest possible `n` is `2 * diff`, since the number of people is even.
5. We increment `n` by `2 * diff` until `n` is a multiple of `diff`. This is because the difference between `b` and `a` must be a multiple of the total number of people.
6. We calculate the value of `d` by adding `diff` to `c`.
7. We check if `d` is a multiple of `n`, is positive, and is less than or equal to `n`. If all these conditions are true, we print `d`. Otherwise, we print -1.

This solution has a time complexity of O(t), which is much faster than the brute-force approach. We use mathematical properties of the problem to reduce the search space and find the solution more efficiently.

Note that this solution uses the fact that the difference between `b` and `a` must be a multiple of the total number of people. This allows us to find the smallest possible `n` that satisfies the conditions, which in turn allows us to find the value of `d`.
