This is a CodeForces problem:

Steph wants to improve her knowledge of algorithms over winter break. She has a total of X (1 <= X <= 104) minutes to dedicate to learning algorithms. There are N (1 <= N <= 100) algorithms, and each one of them requires a_i (1 <= a_i <= 100) minutes to learn. Find the maximum number of algorithms she can learn.

Input

Line 1:

Two space-separated integers N and X.

Line 2:

space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_N

Output
A single integer, the answer to the problem.

Please solve this problem using a bruteforce algorithm in Python.
Your solution must not use algorithms and data structures except the most primitive ones.
You must use bruteforce and implement correct IO.

This is a CodeForces problem:

Some number of people (this number is even) have stood in a circle. The people stand in the circle evenly. They are numbered clockwise, starting from a person with the number 1. Each person is looking through the circle's center at the opposite person.

You don't know the exact number of people standing in the circle (but this number is even, no doubt). It is known that the person with the number a is looking at the person with the number b (and vice versa, of course). What is the number associated with a person being looked at by the person with the number c? If, for the specified a, b, and c, no such circle exists, output -1.

Input
The first line contains one integer t (1 <= t <= 104) - the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

Each test case consists of one line containing three distinct integers a, b, c (1 <= a, b, c <= 108).

Output

For each test case output in a separate line, a single integer d—the number of the person being looked at by the person with the number c in a circle such that the person with the number a is looking at the person with the number b. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. Output −1 if there's no circle meeting the given conditions.

Please solve this problem using a bruteforce algorithm in Python. Your solution must not use algorithms and data structures except the most primitive ones.


>> Llama 3.1 70b:
Here is a Python solution using a bruteforce algorithm:

```python
def solve(a, b, c):
    for n in range(2, 10**8, 2):  # n is even
        if (a + n // 2 - 1) % n + 1 == b:
            return (c + n // 2 - 1) % n + 1
    return -1

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    print(solve(a, b, c))
```

This solution works by iterating over all possible even values of `n` (the number of people in the circle) and checking if the condition `(a + n // 2 - 1) % n + 1 == b` is satisfied. If it is, it returns the person being looked at by `c`, which is `(c + n // 2 - 1) % n + 1`. If no such `n` is found, it returns -1.

Now, solve this problem by leveraging the most optimal algorithms and data structures.


>> Llama 3.1 70b:
Here is a Python solution using the most optimal algorithms and data structures:

```python
def solve(a, b, c):
    diff = abs(a - b)
    if diff % 2 != 0 or a == b:
        return -1
    diff //= 2
    return (c + diff) if a < b else (c - diff)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    print(solve(a, b, c))
```

This solution works by calculating the difference between `a` and `b`, which represents the radius of the circle. If the difference is odd or `a` and `b` are equal, or if the difference is odd, it returns -1, because no such circle exists.

Otherwise, it calculates the person being looked at by `c` by adding or subtracting the radius from `c`, depending on whether `a` is less than or greater than `b`. This is because if `a` is less than `b`, `c` is being looked at by someone to its right, and if `a` is greater than `b`, `c` is being looked at by someone to its left.

This solution has a time complexity of O(1), making it much more efficient than the previous bruteforce solution.

This is a CodeForces problem:

This is an interactive problem.
This is an easy version of the problem. The difference from the hard version is that in the easy version t=1 and the number of queries is limited to 20.

Polycarp is playing a computer game. In this game, an array consisting of zeros and ones is hidden. Polycarp wins if he guesses the position of the k-th zero from the left t times.

Polycarp can make no more than 20 requests of the following type:
? l r — find out the sum of all elements in positions from l to r (1 <= l <= r <= n) inclusive.

In this (easy version) of the problem, this paragraph doesn't really make sense since t=1 always. To make the game more interesting, each guessed zero turns into one and the game continues on the changed array. More formally, if the position of the k-th zero was x, then after Polycarp guesses this position, the x-th element of the array will be replaced from 0 to 1. Of course, this feature affects something only for t>1.

Help Polycarp win the game.

Interaction

First, your program must read two integers n and t (1 <= n <= 2*105, t = 1). Then, t lines follow, each of which contains one integer k (1 <= k <= n). It is guaranteed that at the moment of the request, the array contains at least k zeros. In order to get the next value of k, you must output the answer for the current value of k.

After that, you can make no more than 20 requests.
Use the following format to output the answer (it is not a request, it doesn't count in 20):
! x — position of the k-th zero.
Positions in the array are numbered from left to right from 1 to n inclusive. After printing t answers, your program should exit immediately.

In this task, the interactor is not adaptive. This means that within the same test, the hidden array and the queries do not change. In case of an incorrect query, -1 will be displayed. When this value is received, your program must immediately exit normally (for example, by calling exit(0)), otherwise, the testing system may issue an arbitrary verdict. If the number of requests is exceeded, the verdict wrong answer will be displayed.

Your solution may get the verdict Idleness limit exceeded if you don't print anything or forget to flush the output buffer. To flush the output buffer, you need to do the following immediately after the query output and the end-of-line character:
fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C ++;
System.out.flush() in Java;
flush(output) in Pascal;
stdout.flush() in Python;
see the documentation for other languages.
Please solve this problem using a bruteforce algorithm in Python. Your solution must not use algorithms and data structures except the most primitive ones. Ignore the 20 requests requirement.


>> Llama 3.1 70b:
Here is a Python solution using a bruteforce algorithm:

```python
import sys

def query(l, r):
    print(f"? {l} {r}")
    sys.stdout.flush()
    return int(input())

def solve(n, t, k):
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if query(i, i) == 0:
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                print(f"! {i}")
                sys.stdout.flush()
                return

n, t = map(int, input().split())
for _ in range(t):
    k = int(input())
    solve(n, t, k)
```

This solution works by iterating over each position in the array and making a query to check if the element at that position is 0. If it is, it decrements the counter `k`. If `k` becomes 0, it means we have found the `k`-th zero, so we print the position and return.

Note that this solution ignores the 20 requests requirement and makes a query for each position in the array. This is not efficient and will not work for large inputs, but it is a simple bruteforce solution that works for small inputs.

Also, this solution uses `sys.stdout.flush()` to flush the output buffer after printing the query, as required by the problem statement.

def query(l, r):

def solve(n, t, k):
    l, r = 1, n
    while l < r:
        m = (l + r) // 2
        cnt = query(l, m)
        if cnt >= k:
            r = m
        else:
            l = m + 1
            k -= cnt
    print(f"! {l}")
    sys.stdout.flush()

n, t = map(int, input().split())
for _ in range(t):
    k = int(input())
    solve(n, t, k)
```

This solution works by using a binary search approach to find the `k`-th zero. It maintains a range `[l, r]` of possible positions for the `k`-th zero, and repeatedly divides the range in half by making a query to count the number of zeros in the left half.

If the count of zeros in the left half is greater than or equal to `k`, it means the `k`-th zero is in the left half, so it updates `r` to be the midpoint. Otherwise, it means the `k`-th zero is in the right half, so it updates `l` to be the midpoint plus one and subtracts the count of zeros in the left half from `k`.

This process continues until `l` and `r` converge to a single position, which is the position of the `k`-th zero. It then prints the position and returns.

This solution uses a binary search approach, which reduces the number of queries from `O(n)` to `O(log n)`, making it much more efficient than the previous bruteforce solution.
